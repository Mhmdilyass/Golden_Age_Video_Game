# When Was The Golden Age of Video Games?
In this project, as a data analyst i will analyze video game critic and user scores as well as sales data for the top 400 video games released since 1977. I will search for the golden age of video games by identifying the release years that users and critics liked the most and will explore the game business side by looking at game sales data.

The search will involve combining data sets and comparing the results with set theory. This project will also filter, group, and sort data.
